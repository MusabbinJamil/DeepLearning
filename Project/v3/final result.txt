We tried replicating the project as mentioned in the report link above.
Unfortunately we weren't able to get much reuslts, we tried training a 
Siamese Neural Network which was a step back from what was demonstrated in the report
but our accuracies could not reach a usable value in the time that we had. Nonetheless, 
our attempt is provided in the form of the notebook named "Deep_learning_project_v3.ipynb".
